ðŸŒ± I love this profession. Sometimes you don't sleep well, getting up early, being a dad isn't easy, and neither is being a developer, but perseverance and the desire to learn something new motivates you. Being able to help create solutions for people is satisfying, you have to leave your mark.

âš¡ I identify myself as a person eager for knowledge, learning and being able to share my knowledge with others.
